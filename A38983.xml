            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AT the Committee of both Houſes, appointed to hear and examine Sir <hi>Tho. Cooke,</hi> in purſuance of the Act, intituled, <hi>An Act to indemnifie Sir</hi> Thomas Cooke <hi>from Actions which he might be liable to, by reaſon of his diſcovering to whom he paid and diſtributed ſeveral ſums of money therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to be received out of the Treaſure of the</hi> Eaſt India <hi>Company; or for any proſecution for ſuch distribution.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="deposition">
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Cooke</hi> being called in, and the Act read, he thereupon obſerved to the ſaid Committee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing relating to the Clauſe touching his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and did deſire, that in caſe he ſhould then make a full and perfect diſcovery, to the ſatisfaction of the Committee, it might by them be repreſented to each Houſe, ſo as he might obtain their Votes for his diſcharge; he apprehending by the Act, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is impowered to releaſe him in Caſe of ſuch diſcovery. Whereupon the Committee acquainted him, <hi>That they were of Opinion, if he made a full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, he would not be liable to the Penalty of that Act; but however, his ſcruple ſhould he fairly repreſented to both Houſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Cook</hi> being ſworn, acquainted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, <hi>That for their eaſe he had put his Confeſſion down in writing;</hi> a Copy whereof is hereunto annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The Original being read by him, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee conceiving it to be imperfect, and not ſuch as the Act requires, the Committee let him know, <hi>That they expected a more particular account of thoſe matters from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the firſt Sum of 10000 l. mentioned in the ſaid writing, he ſaith, the ſame was payed to Mr. <hi>Tyſon</hi> in <hi>November</hi> 1692.</p>
               <p>That he gave him no Directions how it ſhould be diſpoſed; but it was in expectation to have the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company confirmed, and New Regulations thereto made; and they concluded it for the ſervice of the Company. It was intended for the ſervice of the King, but he could not ſay the King had it.</p>
               <p>He believes the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company never had any account how this 10000 l. was diſpoſed. He told the Court, as he remembers, <hi>That he had dispoſed of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and they required no account thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He believes Mr. <hi>Tyſon</hi> told him, that he delivered it to Sir <hi>Joſias Child,</hi> who delivered it to the King. He ſaith, 'tis a Cuſtomary Preſent, and that in King <hi>Charles</hi>'s and other former Reigns the like had been done for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years, which by the books of the Company may appear.</p>
               <p>That the Company, when this Preſent was made, were in an ill condition; That he himſelf advanced this ſum, and had it not repaid in 4 or 5 months time; the ſame, with the intereſt thereupon due, was preſented to the King in Tallies.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100663:2"/>
               <p>As to the 10000 l. and 2000 l. next mentioned in the Account, he ſaith, thoſe ſums were paid to Mr. <hi>Richard Acton</hi> about the ſame time; who declared he had ſeveral Friends capable of doing great ſervice to the Companies Affairs; and ſeveral of them would ſpeak with parliament-men; That he could not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize who they were, but the end aim'd at, was to get an <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Cook</hi> offer'd to give the Company an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how the mony was diſpoſed of, but they did not think fit to receive it. And further ſaith, That he knows no man, beſides Mr. <hi>Acton,</hi> who can give an Account who had that mony. That he intruſted this mony wholly with Mr. <hi>Acton,</hi> taking him for an <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>able man,</hi> the Court having given him Power (as he conceiv'd) to diſpoſe of the mony by another hand, as well as by his own.</p>
               <p>That the inducements for giving this mony, were fears of the <hi>Interlopers</hi> going out, and <hi>Subſcriptions for a New Company going on,</hi> by which they <hi>apprehended pany would be ruin'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That to the beſt of his Remembrance, there was a Bill at that time for another <hi>Eaſt-India Company;</hi> and that the King had ſent a <hi>Meſſage to the Houſe of Com- the Commons</hi> to ſettle the <hi>Eaſt-India Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this 10000 l. was Advanced by <hi>Acton</hi> himſelf, and not repayed him in ſome Months after, which <hi>mony,</hi> he believes, <hi>Acton</hi> paid away the ſame <hi>Seſſion;</hi> the other 2000 l. to <hi>Acton,</hi> was for <hi>Interest</hi> and his <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Expences,</hi> which were great.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acton</hi> did ſay he could tell ſome Perſons imployed in that <hi>Affair,</hi> he did underſtand that this Money was to be laid out <hi>for promoting their Affairs in Parliament,</hi> could not ſay to whom it was given, but underſtood <hi>it went no furnher than the Houſe of Commons,</hi> and that he found no <hi>good Fruit by ſuch Diſtribution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Mr. <hi>Acton</hi> at that time had an <hi>intereſt in the Eaſt-India Company,</hi> to the value of 10 or 20000 l. as he believes, and had ſo for ſome time.</p>
               <p>That he gave this 10000 <hi>l.</hi> with the Privity of Sir <hi>Jeſias Child,</hi> who recommended <hi>Acton</hi> as a Perſon ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing the <hi>Company Service,</hi> having <hi>great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Parliament Men, and others who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he knows not who <hi>Acton</hi> Employed in the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of this Mony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the 338 l. 7. s. 6 d. mentioned to be paid to Mr. <hi>Molineaux,</hi> he ſaith, the ſame was paid him about the ſame time the money was paid to Mr. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton;</hi> That Mr. <hi>Molineaux</hi> told him, <hi>this money was to be diſp ſed of to the Lord</hi> Rivers; but further ſaith, <hi>that ſince his confinement</hi> Molineaux <hi>had been with him, to tell him, that it was a w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>As to the farther Sum of 250 l. mentioned in the ſaid Paper, to be paid Mr. <hi>Tyſon,</hi> for the ſervice of the <hi>Company;</hi> he ſaith, <hi>it was paid him about the ſame time, and was in relation to</hi> Salt Petre, <hi>but he cannot give a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

               </p>
               <p>As to the 220l. mention'd to be paid to Sir <hi>John Chardin,</hi> he believes it was for his own uſe, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended great ſums in the Companies ſervice.</p>
               <p>As to the 350l. paid to Mr. <hi>Dockminique,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>He believes the ſame was Expended by him, but he knows, not to whom he gave it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the 382 l. 1 s. 8 d. paid to Capt. <hi>Jermain,</hi> he ſaith; <hi>That Mr.</hi> Jermain <hi>told him he had loſt</hi> 700 l. <hi>in the Intereſt of the Interlopers, who finding that Interest to decline, applied himſelf to him, the ſaid Sir</hi> Thomas Cook, <hi>propoſing that if he might have half the monies, which he had lost, repaid him, he would come into the</hi> Eaſt-India Company's <hi>Interest,</hi> upon which conſideration the ſaid 382 l. 1 s. 8 d. was paid him.</p>
               <p>As to the 1091. l. 13 s. 4 d. paid to Mr. <hi>Fitzpatrick,</hi> Deceas'd, he ſaith, <hi>That</hi> Fitzpatrick <hi>told him he had a great Interest with the Lord</hi> Nottingham, <hi>that he would try what he could do, and he did not doubt but he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh great Services, provided he might have ſuch a Sum of Mony; but he believes the ſaid</hi> Fitzpatrick <hi>kept the Money himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there was a promiſe of a further Sum, if the intended Act of Parliament did not paſs.</p>
               <p>As to the 545 l. 16 s. 8 s. it was to be paid Mr. <hi>Charles Bates,</hi> when the Charter was ſettled, and was paid accordingly in <hi>October</hi> 1693. He himſelf had no acquaintance with him; but Sir <hi>Bazil Firebrace</hi> told him, <hi>He had acquaintance with ſeveral Lords, and named the Marqueſs of</hi> Carmarthen, <hi>now Duke of</hi> Leeds.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt 10000 l. paid to Sir <hi>Baſil Firebrace,</hi> it was paid him about <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1693. And it was always his apprehenſion that Sir <hi>Bazil Firebrace</hi> kept it for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to recompence his Loſſes in the <hi>Interloping Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the ſeveral other ſums which compleat the farther ſum of 30000 l. paid to Sir <hi>Bazil,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>They were paid at one time, tho depending upon ſeveral Contracts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it was agreed, in caſe the Charter paſſed, the Company, ſhould take 60000 l. ſtock of Sir <hi>Bazil Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,</hi> at 150 l. <hi>per Cent.</hi> When the Charter was paſſed, he put this ſtock upon the Company at 150 <hi>l. per Cent;</hi> Their Stock was then at 100 l. <hi>per Cent.</hi> by which the Company loſt 30000 l. He ſaith, <hi>He never could tell to whom this mony was diſtributed; nor would Sir</hi> Bazil Firebrace <hi>give him an Account of that matter, tho often asked by him to do it; and Sir</hi> Bazil <hi>ſaid, If he were farther preſſed, he would have no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>That the Charter being paſſed, the <hi>Company</hi> paid the 30000 l. about <hi>January</hi> 1693. In recompence for the fall of the Stock, the Company was alſo to Transfer 40000 l. more Stock at 100 l. <hi>per Cent.</hi> if an Act paſſed in 18 Months for Confirming and inlarging their Charter; but the <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> not being paſſed, the Contract for that 40000 l. ſtock became void.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Cook</hi> produc'd a Contract dated <hi>Sept.</hi> 19. 1693. which was mentioned to be made in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 300 <hi>Guineas</hi> paid to him, which conſideration he declared he had not Received.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe produced another contract, dated <hi>Octob.</hi> 25. 1692.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100663:2"/>
               <p>He ſaith, <hi>There were ſeveral Contracts, ſome to the value of</hi> 6000 l. on account of Procuring a <hi>New Charter,</hi> and others, to the value of 40000 l. on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of procuring an <hi>Act of Parliament;</hi> They were all in Sir <hi>Bazil Firebraces</hi> Name, one of each ſort by him produced to ſhew the Nature of their Contracts.</p>
               <p>He ſaith, <hi>The</hi> 30000 <hi>l. was paid to Sir</hi> Bazil Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, <hi>or his Order, upon Ten ſeveral Contracts.</hi> It was paid in ſix ſeveral Sums, <hi>viz.</hi> 15 or 20000 l. (and he thinks 10000 l. a peice, becauſe no more than that ſum can be ſubſcribed by one perſon) to <hi>Fowles</hi> and <hi>Wooton,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Edward Allen</hi> 5000 l. to Mr. <hi>Horneby</hi> 5000l. That the 30000 l. and 10000 l. were ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the <hi>East-India Company;</hi> and he believes the ſubſcribers can give better Information as to theſe ſums.</p>
               <p>He did not know but the reaſon why the 30000 l. was in ten ſeveral contracts might be, becauſe Sir <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil</hi> might have occaſion to diſtribute it to ſeveral Perſons.</p>
               <p>As to the 90000 l. he ſaith, <hi>That it was</hi> 99197 l. <hi>Stock bought for</hi> 90000 l. <hi>of ſeveral perſons for the uſe of the Company, to make good the contracts with Sir</hi> Bazil, <hi>if he ſhould chooſe to accept the Stock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Stock was transferr'd to ſeveral perſons, to the Company's uſe; That he was accountable for it; That they had his own Obligation for the ſame; part of which ſtock was transferr'd to the Company, other part was ſold to their uſe, and they have the money.</p>

               <p>That the ſaid ſum of 30000 l. was received by him by vertue of a Contract with Sir <hi>Tho. Cook,</hi> it was for <hi>Favours</hi> and <hi>Services</hi> done.</p>
               <p>That the Stock at the time of the Contract valued at 150 l. <hi>per Cent.</hi> falling afterwards to 100 l. <hi>per cent.</hi> the difference was 30000 l. which they made up to him.</p>
               <p>That the reaſon of the fall of the Stock, <hi>was the Ships not coming in,</hi> and if that had not happened, he the Deponent had gain'd as much as the 30000 l. paid him.</p>

                  <hi>That he was unwilling to take too much upon himſelf; he thought he did great Service to the Company in Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and other Services.

               <p>That he, this Deponent, did uſe his Intereſt with the Lord <hi>Preſident,</hi> who ſaid he would do what ſervice he could; and further ſaith, <hi>That the Lord Preſident had delivered his Opinion publickly for confirming the</hi> Charter, <hi>and thought the forfeiture an hardſhip.</hi>

               <p>That the Lord Preſident had often ſhewed himſelf his Friend.</p>

               <p>That the ſaid Notes were not out of his Poſſeſſion from the time that he firſt had them, to the time he gave them to Monſieur <hi>Robart</hi> to receive the mony, who after he had received the mony, brought the ſame to him, which hath remained in his, the Deponent's, Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion in his own Houſe, till he paid 4400 <hi>Guineas</hi> thereof back again to Sir <hi>Bazil,</hi> which was upon <hi>Monday</hi> or <hi>Tueſday</hi> laſt, as he takes it; and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined again to the ſame matter, ſaith, that theſe 4400 <hi>Guineas</hi> paid back to Sir <hi>Baſil,</hi> were in four Bags, with 11 hundred <hi>Guineas</hi> in each, brought to him by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart</hi> within a Month laſt paſt.

He thereupon applied himſelf to Mr. <hi>Bates,</hi> who would not pretend to talk with the Duke, but ſaid he, the Deponent, muſt tell him what the Company would do, that he told Mr. <hi>Bates</hi> he thought a Preſent would be made of 2 or 3000 l. Mr. <hi>Bates</hi> told him he went to <hi>St. James</hi>'s, and ſaid he had ſpoke with his Friend, and that more had been offered on the other ſide. At an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

               <p>He acquainted Sir <hi>Thomas Cooke</hi> with this Propoſal, who ſaid, <hi>if it was inſisted on it muſt be done,</hi> and ſo it was agreed to offer 5000 <hi>Guineas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bates</hi> ſaid, this was nothing to him, that he ought not to be imployed for nothing; on which this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent was forc'd to go back to Sir <hi>Thomas Cooke</hi> for new Ordess; and ſo 500 Guinea's were given to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. At firſt <hi>Bates</hi> ſaid, he would undertake no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than that the Duke ſhould not oppoſe, but be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; becauſe he did not know but the Duke had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf by ſpeaking on the other ſide.

               <p>It was agreed, that if the Duke did act in favour of the Company, he ſhould have two or three thouſand Guineas, and <hi>Bates</hi> 500 Guineas to himſelf. He this Deponent would have put off his 500 Guineas to the laſt, to engage him to take the more pains; but <hi>Bates</hi> ſaid, his Friend would have him have the 500 Guineas to himſelf firſt.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Baſil</hi> produced a Copy of Mr. <hi>Bates</hi>'s Receipt for a Note of 30<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thot after the firſt Chatter was paſſed in <hi>October,</hi> he ſent to Mr, <hi>Bates,</hi> that he might call for the money; and he did call for it in two or three days. That the other Note was paid within a week after the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſecond Charter; for the time the Notes were given we had free acceſs to my Lord Preſident, and found him eaſie and willing to give us his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>That Mr. <hi>Bates</hi> was ſhy, and called it his Friend at St. <hi>James</hi>'s; that the condition of One Draught which Mr. <hi>Bates</hi> brought, was worded, <hi>In caſe the Lord Preſident did not aſſiſt the Company in paſſing the Charter;</hi> to which this Deponent made an Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by putting out my Lord's Name, and making it not payable in caſe the Charter ſhould not paſs, or to that Effect. <hi>Bates</hi> ſaid, it came from his Friend at St. <hi>James</hi>'s.</p>
